  Summary:
  - Ensure README content clearly explains what the web-search agent does, how
    to configure it via environment variables, how to run tests, how to use
    the CLI, and how to start the MCP server, with examples.

  Content expectations:
  - Include a concise overview of the Pydantic AI web-search agent and
    supported backends (Brave, SearXNG).
  - Document environment variables with descriptions and reference to
    `.env.example`.
  - Provide instructions for:
    - Setting up a development environment.
    - Running tests with pytest.
    - Running the CLI in single-command and REPL modes, with example commands.
    - Starting the FastMCP server and invoking its tools (at least `web_search`).
  - Reference docs/PLANNING.md and docs/TASKS.md for deeper architectural and
    task details.

  Scope:
  - This task focuses on documentation clarity and completeness, not on
    changing code.
  - It should be performed after core agent, CLI, and MCP functionality is in
    place so examples reflect reality.
