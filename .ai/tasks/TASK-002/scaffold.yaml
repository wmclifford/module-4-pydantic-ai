  notes: |
    All planned diffs have been successfully applied. The configuration module is fully implemented with:
    - Pydantic models for LLM and search backend configuration
    - load_config() function that reads and validates environment variables
    - Enforcement that at least one search backend is configured
    - Comprehensive unit tests (30 tests, all passing)
    - GitHub Actions CI workflow for linting and testing
    - .env.example documentation file
    - All code passes ruff linting and formatting checks
