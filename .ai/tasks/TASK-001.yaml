taskTitle: Design and scaffold web_search_agent package layout
status: done
rationale: >-
  Create the initial Python package structure for the Pydantic AI web-search
  agent so that later tasks can focus on configuration, tools, agent logic, MCP
  integration, and CLI behavior without worrying about layout. This task
  establishes the `web_search_agent` package, core modules, and a minimal CLI
  entry point stub.

notes: |
  - The `web_search_agent` package must exist and be importable.
  - Create the following modules with high-level docstrings describing their
    responsibilities only (no full business logic yet):
    - web_search_agent/config.py: configuration loading interfaces and
      placeholder Pydantic models.
    - web_search_agent/models.py: placeholder data models for search results
      and related entities.
    - web_search_agent/tools.py: placeholder module for Brave and SearXNG tool
      implementations.
    - web_search_agent/agent.py: placeholder module for the Pydantic AI agent
      definition.
    - web_search_agent/mcp_server.py: placeholder module for FastMCP server
      wiring.
    - web_search_agent/cli.py: CLI entrypoints (stubs) for single-command and
      REPL modes.
  - A CLI stub should be wired either via `main.py` or a console script so that
    it can be invoked from the command line and print at least a help or
    version message.
  - No external API calls (Brave/SearXNG) or Pydantic AI agent logic should be
    implemented in this task; those are deferred to later tasks (TASK-002 and
    onward).
  - Add a basic test file `tests/test_package_layout.py` to verify that the
    `web_search_agent` package and its core modules can be imported.
